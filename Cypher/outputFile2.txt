it is a most extraordinary thing, but i never read a patent medicine  oadvertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that i am  osuffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most  ovirulent form.  the diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly  owith all the sensations that i have ever felt. o oi remember going to the british museum one day to read up the treatment  ofor some slight ailment of which i had a touch  hay fever, i fancy it  owas.  i got down the book, and read all i came to read; and then, in an  ounthinking moment, i idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently  ostudy diseases, generally.  i forget which was the first distemper i  oplunged into  some fearful, devastating scourge, i know  and, before i  ohad glanced half down the list of "premonitory symptoms," it was borne in  oupon me that i had fairly got it. o oi sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of  odespair, i again turned over the pages.  i came to typhoid fever  read  othe symptoms  discovered that i had typhoid fever, must have had it for  omonths without knowing it  wondered what else i had got; turned up st.  ovitusrs dance  found, as i expected, that i had that too,  began to get  ointerested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so  ostarted alphabetically  read up ague, and learnt that i was sickening  ofor it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another  ofortnight.  brightrs disease, i was relieved to find, i had only in a  omodified form, and, so far as that was concerned, i might live for years.   ocholera i had, with severe complications; and diphtheria i seemed to have  obeen born with.  i plodded conscientiously through the twentysix  oletters, and the only malady i could conclude i had not got was  ohousemaidrs knee.
