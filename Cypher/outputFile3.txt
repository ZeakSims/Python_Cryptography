"no," said harris, "if you want rest and change, you canot beat a sea   ltrip."  l  li objected to the sea trip strongly.  a sea trip does you good when you   lare going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is   lwicked.  l  lyou start on monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are   lgoing to enjoy yourself.  you wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore,   llight your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were   lcaptain cook, sir francis drake, and christopher columbus all rolled into   lone.  on tuesday, you wish you hadnot come.  on wednesday, thursday, and   lfriday, you wish you were dead.  on saturday, you are able to swallow a   llittle beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet   lsmile when kindhearted people ask you how you feel now.  on sunday, you   lbegin to walk about again, and take solid food.  and on monday morning,   las, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale,   lwaiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.  l  li remember my brotherinlaw going for a short sea trip once, for the   lbenefit of his health.  he took a return berth from london to liverpool;   land when he got to liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to   lsell that return ticket.  l  lit was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so i am told;   land was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a biliouslooking youth who   lhad just been advised by his medical men to go to the seaside, and take   lexercise.  l  l"seaside!" said my brotherinlaw, pressing the ticket affectionately   linto his hand; "why, youoll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as   lfor exercise! why, youoll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship,   lthan you would turning somersaults on dry land."  l  lhe himself  my brotherinlaw  came back by train.  he said the north  lwestern railway was healthy enough for him.
